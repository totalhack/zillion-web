Generic single-database configuration.

After changing a model (for example, adding a column), inside the container,
create a revision, e.g.:

```console $ alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User
model" ```

Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what
will actually change the database):

```console $ alembic upgrade head ```

If you don't want to use migrations at all, uncomment the line in the file at
`./backend/app/app/db/init_db.py` with:

and comment the line in the file `prestart.sh` that contains:

```console $ alembic upgrade head ```
