    start making your changes to the **master** branch (or branch off of it).
3.  Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works
    as expected.
4.  Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Add yourself to

### Questions

The GitHub issue tracker is for *bug reports* and *feature requests*. Please do
not use it to ask questions about how to use Zillion Web.

## Good Bug Reports

Please be aware of the following things when filing bug reports:

1. Avoid raising duplicate issues. *Please* use the GitHub issue search feature
   to check whether your bug report or feature request has been mentioned in
   the past. Duplicate bug reports and feature requests are a huge maintenance
   burden on the limited resources of the project. If it is clear from your
   report that you would have struggled to find the original, that's ok, but
   if searching for a selection of words in your issue title would have found
   the duplicate then the issue will likely be closed.
2. When filing bug reports about exceptions or tracebacks, please include the
   *complete* traceback. Partial tracebacks, or just the exception text, are
   not helpful. Issues that do not contain complete tracebacks may be closed
   without warning.
3. Make sure you provide a suitable amount of information to work with.
